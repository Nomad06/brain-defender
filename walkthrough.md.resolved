# Focusan Design Walkthrough

I have completed the design and implementation of the **Focusan** extension pages. The design follows the Japanese Zen and Bushidō principles, utilizing a color palette of indigo, off-white, and bamboo green.

## 1. Popup (Small Window)
The popup serves as the primary interface for starting focus sessions. It features a circular timer designed to look like a Zen circle (Enso) and displays daily Japanese characters to inspire focus.

**Features:**
- **Timer**: A visual countdown ring that unifies the concept of *Bottō* (immersion).
- **Daily Quote**: A randomly selected Zen concept (e.g., "Immersion") to set the tone.
- **Minimal Controls**: Simple start/pause interactions to reduce cognitive load.

## 2. Block Page
When a user visits a distracted site, they are greeted with this calming barrier instead of a harsh error message.

**Features:**
- **Breathing Animation**: A gentle, pulsing circle guides the user to take a breath before returning to work.
- **Reminders**: Text emphasizing *Keizoku* (continuity) rather than punishment.
- **Aesthetics**: Deep blue background to induce calmness.

## 3. Settings Page
The settings page allows users to configure their focus environment.

### Dashboard
Overview of focus statistics to track *Kaizen* (continuous improvement).

*(Note: Screenshot above shows the Settings tab, below are specific sections)*

### Blocklist Management
Simple interface to manage distracted sites.

### Schedule
Set work hours to automatically enforce discipline.

## Verification
All pages have been verified in the browser. The responsive layouts work as expected, and the animations (breathing, appearing text) perform smoothly.
